Subject: Data Analysis Summary: Key Findings, Trends, and Next Steps

Dear Product or Business Leader,

I hope this message finds you well. I've completed an initial analysis of our user, product, and transaction data, and I'd like to share some key findings and areas where we need further clarification.

Key Data Quality Issues and Questions:

1. Missing Data: We have significant gaps in crucial fields across our datasets. For instance, 93% of products lack CATEGORY_4 information, and 30% of users have no LANGUAGE data.

2. Inconsistent Formats: Some fields, like FINAL_QUANTITY and FINAL_SALE in transactions, contain non-numeric values, complicating our analysis.

3. Data Integrity: We've found negative barcodes and unusually low barcode values, which raise concerns about data entry processes.

4. Duplicate Entries: Both product and transaction datasets contain duplicate rows, potentially skewing our analyses.

Outstanding Questions:
- How should we interpret and use the multi-level category system (CATEGORY_1 to CATEGORY_4) for products?
- What's the distinction between MANUFACTURER and BRAND fields?
- How should we handle placeholder birthdates (e.g., "1970-01-01") in user data?

Interesting Trend:
Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between long-term user engagement and sales. The top 5 brands by sales among users with accounts older than six months closely mirror the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for users over 21. This suggests that focusing on retaining users and encouraging regular engagement could significantly boost sales for key brands.

Top 5 Brands (by sales, 6+ month accounts):
1. COCA-COLA: $2,592.10
2. ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN GROCERY: $2,383.92
3. DOVE: $2,327.47
4. BAREFOOT: $2,284.59
5. ORIBE: $2,085.93

Additional Finding:
In the Dips & Salsa category, TOSTITOS is the clear leader with total sales of $103,354.84. This insight could be valuable for category management and promotional strategies.

Request for Action:
To resolve these issues and deepen our analysis, we need:

1. Clarification on data collection processes, especially for fields with high missing rates.
2. Guidelines on handling inconsistent data formats and placeholder values.
3. A review of the product categorization system to ensure accurate classification.
4. Input on prioritizing which data quality issues to address first, based on business impact.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss these findings and next steps with you. Please let me know when you're available for a brief meeting.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
Yonah
